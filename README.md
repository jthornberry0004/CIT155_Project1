Project 1 for CIT 155 class
#Jordon Thornberry
This assignment was created for my CIT 155 class to design a website with 5 webpages and an associating CSS page. The topic was open choice so I made the decision to go with the Dragon Lance series. The First page (index) is to give a brief overview on why I chose this choice and the books within the series. The next two pages give a very brief summary on the books in both the Chronicles series and the Lost Chronicles series. Next page gives a brief overview of the main characters within the stories. And finally the last page gives a description of the authors and what led them to creating this series.
