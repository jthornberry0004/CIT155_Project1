		<h2>Chromatic vs. Metallic</h2>
		<p>You ask what do colors and metals have to do with dragons in Dragon Lance? Actually quite a'lot in fact. Dragons arent simply mindess beast
		in Dragon Lance that are prone to attack anyone and anything and hoarding treasure (some do but not all). In fact Dragons are very intelligent gifted
		with language and a small measure of magic. This difference lies in what side do they fall on. The Chromatic (color) dragons are evil aligned and follow
		and worship the Dark Goddess Takhisis. The Chromatic dragons cover the colors Red, Blue, Green, Black, and White. These dragons believe all other
		creatures are beneathe them. The Metallic (metal-color) dragons follow a different path and follow the good dieties. These dragons range from
		Gold, Silver, Copper, and Brass. These dragons would have little interactions with the world but have been known to assist when things get dire.
		Now there is another type of dragon which I will briefly mention. This is the Shadow dragon type. They do not appear in the Chronicles nor the Lost Chronicles
		but do appear elsewhere in the series. They are neither good nor evil more of a neutral/chaotic dragon.</p>

				<tr>
					<td>Red Dragons</td>
					<td>Fire</td>
					<td>Red dragons are known for finding there homes in the mountainous areas of Krynn. They are known for their treasure hoarding
					desires and thus would rather attack with magic first than flame to preserve preys valuables. They are the biggest dragons on Krynn and have the 
					ability to shapeshift into a humanoid form</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Blue Dragons</td>
					<td>Lightning</td>
					<td>Blue dragons prefer the deserts. They are most known for their cooperation out of all the evil dragons. They are most effective 
					when coordinating in a group and prefer to use their magic with their breathe attack. Blues also have the breathe attack of lightning to smite their enemies.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Green Dragons</td>
					<td>Chlorine</td>
					<td>Green Dragons prefer to hide away in the forest. Preferring to avoid straight confrontation they would rather use their 
					devious cunning minds to solve their problems. But when push comes to shove the Green Dragon has a Chlorine breathe attack to use against opponents.
					Just like the Reds the Green dragons are known for their desires to hoarde treasure.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Black Dragons</td>
					<td>Acid</td>
					<td>Black dragons prefer swamps for their homes. Black dragons are known for their ability to breathe underwater for a extended period of time
					and their fierce reputation of being independant to the point of possible unreliability. Black dragons prefer to blind targets with a darkness spell then spray them with
					their acid breathe attack.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>White Dragons</td>
					<td>Ice</td>
					<td>White dragons prefer frozen wastelands for their home. White dragons are known for their speed of flight being the fastest flyers and because of their home being 
					in ice White dragons do have the ability to breathe underwater. With that being said White dragons are also the smallest dragon and also the slowest thinkers. When
					they do attack they use a cone of frost to freee their prey in ice.</td>
				</tr>

			<caption>Metallics</caption>
			<colgroup class="group1" span="2"></colgroup>
			<colgroup class="group2" span="1"></colgroup>
				<tr>
					<td>Gold Dragons</td>
					<td>Fire and Chlorine</td>
					<td>Gold dragons are known to be rather scholarly and wizardly in their behaviors. Preferring solitude they make their homes in the mountains The keep spellbooks like 
					their mage counterparts. They are the largest of the metallic dragons. They do have the breathe abilities of both the Reds and Greens. When concerning combat the Golds
					would rather use their spells first before any other weapon.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Silver Dragons</td>
					<td>Fire, Frost, and Paralysis</td>
					<td>Silver dragons make their homes around civilization. They prefer the contact and company of humans to dragons. They are the most beloved of dragons in Krynn. Just
					like the Reds they have the ability to shapehift into humanoid form. Also they have the use of a fire breathe attack as well as cone of cold like the Whites and a 
					Paralytic breathe attack.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Brass Dragons</td>
					<td>Sleep and Heat wave</td>
					<td>Like the blues they prefer the desert regions. The Brass dragons are of the mindset that might makes right. When attacked the Brass dragon may use one or
					both of it's breathe weapons. The breathe weapons consist of a sleeping gas or a heat wave to drive away enemies and then use magic to attack if that doesn't work.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Copper Dragons</td>
					<td>Slowness and Acid</td>
					<td>Copper dragons are the smallest of the metallic dragons. They prefer mountainous regions around krynn. They are also known for being the most selfish and self centered.
