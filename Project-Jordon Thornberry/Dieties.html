		<h2>Deities</h2>
		<p>Deities in the Dragon Lance fall into one of three general categories. Good, Neutral, and Evil. Fairly simple and self explanatory. The deities on this page
		are not the only ones in this series. If I was to list and give a brief summary of all dieties in the Dragon Lance pantheon this would take much more time and
		space. So what I have done is list the major playing deities in the Chronicles series. Just as a warning spoilers may be ahead so for those who are interested in
		getting into the series you have been warned.
		<h3>Good</h3>
			<h4>Paladine</h4>
